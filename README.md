# Console-based Board Game

### Overview
This **console-based board game** is a simple yet engaging Python project where a **human player competes against the computer**. The game continues until a player reaches or surpasses the **20th block**, determining the winner. It offers a fun and stress-relieving experience while reinforcing **Python programming concepts** and **game logic implementation**. 

###  Features 
**Console-Based Gameplay** – No graphical interface, making it lightweight and accessible.  
 **PrettyTable for Board Generation** – Displays the board using the `PrettyTable` module (without external dependencies like NumPy).  
 **Automated Game Flow** – The game stops automatically when a player wins.  
 **Turn-Based System** – Players take turns to advance on the board.  

 ###  Technologies & Concepts Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language.  
- **Console-Based UI Development** – Interactive command-line gameplay.  
- **PrettyTable Module** – Generates a structured board layout.  
- **Randomization** – Adds unpredictability to computer moves.  
- **Control Structures & Loops** – Implements game flow logic.  
- **Data Structures** – Uses lists or dictionaries for managing game states.
